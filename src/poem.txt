I Love to Sit in Silence
By Alvin Alexander

I.
I love to sit in silence 
beneath the shady trees
and listen to the songs of birds 
and to the buzz of bees.

II.
I love to sit in silence 
and watch the clouds roll by
Then read a book or sing a song 
and hear the wild bird cry.

III.
I love to sit in silence 
when the day is almost done
and see behind the distant hill 
the paint glow of the sun.

IV.
I love to sit in silence 
in the evening twilight
and listen to the whip-poorwill 
singing with all its might.

V.
I love to sit in silence 
beneath the starry sky
to pray all in earnest 
to live in silence all the while.
